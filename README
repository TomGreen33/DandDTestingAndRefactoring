This project was my submission for the third assignment of my object oriented programming course. In essence,
the course revolved around the development of a level generator for the popular game "Dungeons and Dragons". As
such, each assignment built off of the previous one (there were 4 assignments in total). For the third assignment,
we were tasked with refactoring our second assignment, and to use testing methodologies such as J-Unit Testing
to ensure that the code from our second assignment worked as intended and to help us make the appropriate fixes.
Please note that I do not support any form of plagiarism, and that the purpose of having this code uploaded to my GitHub
is so that employers can assess my technical capabilities.
